# single-spa-examples
This is an example of examples on how to use [single-spa](https://github.com/joeldenning/single-spa) in a variety of contexts. Right now there are examples with the following technologies:

- JSPM
- Babel
- Angular
- Bower

and there will soon be examples for

- React
- Webpack
- Browserify
- Apps on the Global object

## View the demo!
A [demo is live](http://single-spa.surge.sh) on surge.sh. Don't be turned off by the lack of styling -- I'll be fixing that soon.

## How to get the examples running locally
```
git clone git@github.com:joeldenning/single-spa-examples.git
cd single-spa-examples
npm run setup
npm start
open localhost:8000
```
